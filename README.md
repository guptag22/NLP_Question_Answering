Question answering for wikipedia articles using neural networks

This project is an attempt to answer questions posed to a set of articles from Wikipedia using a machine learning model. . The model I chose uses layers of bidirectional long-short-term memory and attention mechanism on the paragraphs and questions to capture the relationships among different words which then helps locate the answer to a factoid question in the text span of the Wikipedia article. This is a part implementation of the paper by Danqi Chen et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051) which describes a state-of-the-art model to tackle open domain questions using Wikipedia articles. The paper proposes a two-part model, first being a document retriever which locates all articles relevant to a particular question, and second part being a document reader which is RNN and attention machine learning model to identify answer to the questions. This project only tries to implement the document reader assuming the relevant article is already known. With a few missing components, this implementation achieves a 0.184 F1 score.
